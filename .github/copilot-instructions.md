Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript, APIs and OpenAI.

We use OpenAI's gpt-4o model, unless asked to use a different model.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

We do NOT use npm libraries or Node SDKs to make requests to APIs.

We use async/await when fetching data from an API.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We do NOT use export statements. Instead we link to JS files from index.html.

We use const and let for variables and template literals for string formatting and DOM insertion.
